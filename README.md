Server Discovery
It took me some and finally I finished the project "Auto Discovery Server". It create a Cloud of servers Simulator in which every server automatically discovered in the network with the shortest path. Passing messages for distributed command computing is possible when the load on one server is high for processing and it then bypass that command to process to another server. #Cloud #distributedcomputing #Simulator #Network
